  * force removal of old diverted files, closes: #126236
  * change priority of liblwres1 from optional to standard per ftp admins
  * add a bind9-host package so that the 'host' provided with the BIND 9.X
    source tree can be an alternative to the aging NIKHEF version packaged
    separately.  Update dnsutils dependencies to depend on one of the two,
    with preference to this one since it has fewer bugs (but fewer features,
    too).

bind9 (1:9.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    against 8.X bind packages, but is just as relevant here!)
  * use rndc for daemon shutdown instead of start-stop-daemon, closes: #111935
  * add a postinst to dnsutils to remove any lingering diversions from old 
    dnsutils packages, closes: #122227
  * not much point in delivering zone2ldap.1 since we aren't delivering 
    zone2ldap right now (though we might someday?), closes: #124058
  * be more verbose with shared library descriptions, closes: #123426, #123428
  * 9.2.0 added a new rndc.key file that both named and rndc will read to 
    obtain a shared key, and rndc-confgen will easily create this file with 
    a unique-per-system key.  Modify named.conf and remove rndc.conf
    to take advantage of this mechanism and stop delivering a pre-determined 
    static key to all Debian systems (which has been a mild security risk).  
    Create the key in postinst if the key file doesn't already exist, and 
    remove the file in postrm if purging.

    include a key file built on the fly during installation while themselves
    retaining conffile status.  The required functionality has been requested
